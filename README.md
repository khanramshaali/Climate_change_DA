**Author:** Ramsha Ali Khan  

## Project Overview  
This project showcases a data-driven dashboard that analyses climate change indicators across multiple countries. It uses SQL for data extraction, Excel for data preparation, and Tableau for visualizations to present trends and insights related to environmental changes over time.

## Objective  
To visualise and compare global climate trends such as temperature change, precipitation, air quality, and extreme weather events through an interactive dashboard that supports both temporal and geographic analysis.

## Key Metrics Analysed
- Average Temperature Trends (Monthly & Yearly)  
- Temperature Variability  
- Precipitation Intensity  
- Air Quality Index (AQI)  
- Frequency of Extreme Weather Events  
- Country-Wise Temperature Changes  
- Seasonal and Monthly Comparisons  

## Tools & Techniques
- **SQL**: Extracted and filtered climate datasets from the source  
- **Excel**: Cleaned, preprocessed, and calculated derived metrics  
- **Tableau**: Built an interactive dashboard with filters and charts

## Features
- Country-level visual comparisons  
- Seasonal and monthly breakdowns  
- KPI cards and interactive visualisations  
- Clean, user-friendly layout for insights at a glance
